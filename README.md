# Image Background Remover

This is a simple Streamlit app that removes the background from an uploaded image using the `rembg` library. The app allows users to upload images, processes them, and lets users download the image with the background removed.

## Features

- Upload an image (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`) with a maximum size of 5MB.
- View the original image and the processed image side by side.
- Download the image with the background removed.
- Built using Streamlit for the front-end and `rembg` for background removal.

## Demo

1. Upload your image.
2. Watch as the background is removed.
3. Download the modified image from the sidebar.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/streamlit-background-remover.git
cd streamlit-background-remover
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Running the App
To run the Streamlit app locally, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run bg_remove.py
```

Once the app is running, open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit, typically http://localhost:8501.
